## Spin

A game hastily thrown together for a game jam with some coworkers. Uses WebGL (THREE.js) and Box2D.

### How to Play

Up to go forward, left and right to turn. The goal is to get to the exit before the timer runs out without dying (touching the walls or obstacles hurts you). Also, the world rotates by 90Â° every few seconds.
